Doesn’t look like much from the outside but don’t be fooled. The seating area is at the back and the food is delicious.  Two vegetarians in the group and the falafel plat was just right.
Kebab was very good. Taste was great and service was very friendly. 10 points to this restaurant (grill). Good value for money !

"This is my favorite spot for Mediterranean food. At first it seems like a small place, don’t get fooled by that first impression. There’s plenty of room in the back. Cozy and great customer service. Not to mention the taste of the food. I love..."
